## Musical Background
I am fluent in baritone voice, violin, acoustic guitar, and mandolin. I have a little piano background as well. I have sung in choir all four and a half years in college. I have sung and played in church dozens of times. I have performed at many weddings as well. I have written original songs and soundtracks, which you can find on my Bandcamp page (https://benschultz.bandcamp.com/). I have recorded at home and I am working with Jason Mathis at Sweetwater to start my home studio. During college, I performed in an Irish college band, This I'll Defend. We even put together a Christmas album, which you can find here: https://thisilldefend.bandcamp.com/album/yuletide
